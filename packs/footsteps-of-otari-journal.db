(Ignore that bit in the AP about his \"perpetual scowl\", the original authors caught him on a bad day.) He is generally warm and outgoing. He loves to inspire the minds and imaginations of people, \"the true source of magic\" as he will often say. He stammers a little in conversation, but is quick witted and a little sarcastic. (Bob Newhart is my real world inspiration for roleplaying him)</p><p>Morli would rather enjoy a cup of team and read about adventure rather than risk his own health and comfort. \"Everything there is to learn you can read in a book.\" He has a scattered collection of fan-fic quality half-finished stories which he is certain will someday be a great work of fiction.</p><p>He is extremely well read, and curious about any any all subjects arcane and occult. Though he can be a bit squeamish with the details. He enjoys creature comforts and luxury more than most, and is a little bit greedy. Not selfishly so, but he will often \"upsell\" customers or provide them with more than they really needed at additional expense.</p><h2>Carlthe</h2><p>Carlthe is a pragmatic and active person who is deeply engaged in the community and local politics. He operates the only printing press in the area from the attic above the bookshop and uses it to publish mostly non-fiction, textbooks for the school, and socialist political pamphlets. It was he who arranged the lucrative contract with Alymora Inkleholtz giving the shop a steady source of income. Though he is uncomfortable with working for the \"Bourgeoisie\" both the bookshop and the press need money - he is foremost a practical man.</p><p>Nevertheless he does publish and distribute posters and pamphlets that promote safe working conditions in the mills and forestry industry, and expose the excesses of the lumber barons and the consortium in Diobel. He is well liked among the workers, who may not always understand what he's on about, but appreciate that he's on their side. On the other hand, the Mayor and many others often do not appreciate what is being written.</p><h2>A Couple</h2><p>Morlibent and Carlthe met at University in Absalom. Disciples of literature and the power of the written word, each applies and interprets its application differently. Many spirited philosophical debates brought them closer together and they have a deep respect and love for each other. Morlibint reaching for people's hearts and minds, and Carlthe for their health and wellbeing. But rather than conflicting they came to see it as two sides of the same coin - though even today they have heated discussions at the table!<br><br>When Carlthe's activism made staying in Absalom difficult, they decided to move to Otari. Back to the basics, to the people, where they could be a beacon of learning and education.
